There are places that radiate a special kind of magic—and Lauterbrunnen is undoubtedly one of them. For Jay and Drashti, this idyllic Swiss valley offered the perfect backdrop for their pre-wedding photoshoot, where majestic scenery met a romantic atmosphere. Jay and Drashti live in New Jersey, USA, and were determined to experience a pre-wedding photoshoot and video in beautiful Switzerland. They found and contacted us through a recommendation from Shivam, who had booked a [surprise proposal photoshoot](/posts/2024/surprise-proposal-fotoshoot-lauterbrunen) with his fiancée Kajal the year before.

It clicked from the very beginning, and we got to enjoy a great planning phase with these warm-hearted people. Using our personalized Location Guide, we explored different locations in Switzerland and developed ideas together. In the end, we decided on a 3-hour photoshoot in Lauterbrunnen and Wengen. The plan was to start in picturesque Lauterbrunnen and stroll through the village for an hour to capture Jay and Drashti’s love. It was also important to Drashti to wear both a dress and a saree for the pre-wedding experience, which allowed us to plan the outfit change perfectly. Later, when we took the train up to Wengen, the couple changed at their hotel, conveniently just a 5-minute walk from Wengen station. But back to Lauterbrunnen: we met at the most famous viewpoint in the village—the shot everyone has seen with the church and the waterfall in the background. Here are the coordinates so you don’t have to search: (46.594786, 7.908343). There are naturally always tourists at this spot. We deliberately scheduled the shoot on a Monday, which really paid off—it was very pleasant in Lauterbrunnen. Jay and Drashti had already been there over the weekend and told us that on Saturday and Sunday there were around 50 people at this spot, making it nearly impossible to take a photo without crowds. As expected, a weekday was perfect. There were only about 15 people, and we waited just 2–3 minutes to have the viewpoint to ourselves for around 5 minutes.

It certainly helped that Jay and Drashti looked like they had stepped straight out of a Disney movie. The two of us (Juliana & Pascal) arrived fully prepared with our camera gear, so the tourists were very kind and gave us space. For productions like this, it’s brilliant that Juliana can photograph while Pascal simultaneously films the pre-wedding short film with the gimbal and a second camera. Want to learn more about [our story](/ueber-uns.html) and why we built a creative agency as a team of two? We’re the perfect dream team for beautiful couple photoshoots (proposal, pre-wedding, after-wedding, etc.).

It’s very important to us to get to know our clients in a few Zoom calls beforehand so that, by the time of the shoot, we already feel familiar. That matters a lot because we aim 100% for naturalness and authenticity—which works best when everyone feels comfortable. With Jay and Drashti, we connected wonderfully from the start, and we truly enjoyed planning the whole experience together. With them, our meetings focused solely on the pre-wedding photoshoot. In separate calls with Jay only, we planned the surprise proposal. Jay’s idea was brilliant: usually the proposal happens before the pre-wedding shoot so that she can already wear the engagement ring for the photos. These photos and videos are then often shown at the wedding.

After the famous viewpoint in Lauterbrunnen, we walked toward the waterfall. Along the way we photographed and filmed while Jay and Drashti soaked up the breathtaking views and atmosphere. We created more beautiful photos and videos at the waterfall, then strolled back along the main street to the train station. The summery weather made the evening simply perfect.

On the train we naturally captured more epic photos with the valley in the background.

At Wengen station, we waited until Jay and Drashti returned—him in a white suit and her in a gorgeous dress. The walk to the viewpoint took about 35 minutes, and on the way we stopped around five times to take photos and film.

The highlight of the evening was, of course, the proposal, which we planned at the viewpoint above Wengen. The magical view and Jay’s surprise proposal made the moment unforgettable. At first, Drashti suspected that Jay might propose, but after two hours the surprise was all the greater. The joy was immense when Jay popped the question in this fairytale setting.

It was perfect—Drashti was completely surprised and overjoyed. The love between them was palpable, and we were able to capture these magical moments in beautiful photos and videos. After the proposal, we gave the two some time alone while we prepared a picnic that Jay had organized for Drashti. Bread, fruit, Swiss chocolate, and cheese—the picnic in the alpine landscape was the second surprise for Drashti, and she was absolutely delighted.

As alpenglow lit up the Jungfrau and the surrounding glaciers, the magic of the evening was complete. Jay and Drashti wandered dreamily through the meadows, sparklers in hand, and celebrated with a bottle of champagne. As dusk fell, we packed everything up and made our way back to Wengen. The mood among us was cheerful and happy. On the way back during blue hour, we created a few more wonderful photos with lanterns and the moon in the background.

Of course, the obligatory selfie couldn’t be missed. ;)

At the end of the evening, we said goodbye at Wengen station. Sharing such intimate moments with other people creates a very special bond, and when we parted, it felt like saying goodbye to good friends. Jay and Drashti also told us they felt they had found friends in us, which made us very happy.
